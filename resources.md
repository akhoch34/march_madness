Competitiveness factor across rounds? Do good seeds generally do well.
Competitiveness and where to draw the line on garbage time. Good FE potentially.

How good are seeds as a proxy for strength? Fit onto pareto distribution?
Model aggressiveness scaled throughout rounds? Would be good to analyze loss function and see if it's advantageous to be extra confident. E.g. locking 1 v 16 or clipping.
how deep to go. A few pbp features would be nice, as well as pace, besides that stick to easier data

Treat conference tourney's specially?

# how does featuretools fit into the modeling process? Any recommendations for evaluating features?

https://towardsdatascience.com/automated-feature-engineering-for-predictive-modeling-d8c9fa4e478b doesn't do much feature evaluation
